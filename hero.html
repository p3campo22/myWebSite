<p> I completely forgot to write out a paragraph about why I chose my grandfather as my hero, but I assure you he is. From day one he alwasy took care of me lke nobody else every could.
There was never a time in my life when I didn't know he was there for me.

<p> I put the ICF as his website because it was an organization that my family was a part of that centered around spending time with the Italian community.
As a family we spent a lot of time with this organization and it became a second family to me.
